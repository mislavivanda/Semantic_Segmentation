# About
Goal of this project was to combine topics of machine learning and advanced computer architectures with focus on semantic segmentation of image/video. 

Hence, as a starting point for this project we have chosen [EchoNet-Dynamic](https://echonet.github.io/dynamic/) deep learning model beacuse of its nature which fits both of previously listed domains and represents a glaring example of modern day technology usage in solving real world problems which is further emphasized with its potential of saving human lives. 

Also, given the complexity of the model, understanding its logic and data flow presented a challenge for us as students, but at the same time brought benefits in terms of marked enhancement of our knowledge about the semantic segmentation process and technologies used in model which were analyzed on both high(programming language) and low(operating system, bare metal) levels of apstraction.
